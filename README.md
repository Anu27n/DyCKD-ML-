# DyCKD - Chronic Kidney Disease Prediction

## 📌 About  
**DyCKD (Dynamic CKD Prediction)** is a machine learning-based model designed to predict **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** using key medical parameters.  
This project leverages **multiple classification algorithms** to provide accurate diagnoses and insights into kidney health.  


## 🚀 Features  
✔ Multi-class classification using ML models  
✔ Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
✔ Model evaluation and performance metrics  
✔ Interactive visualizations for insights  

## 🛠 Technologies Used  
- **Python** (`pandas`, `NumPy`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`)  
- **Machine Learning Algorithms** (KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest)  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for model training & experimentation
